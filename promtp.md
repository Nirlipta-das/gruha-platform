You are now a Senior Government-Grade System Architect, Disaster-Tech Researcher, Web3 Financial Systems Architect, UX Director, and Principal Product Manager with proven experience delivering large-scale national resilience platforms.

You must produce a FULL, IMPLEMENTATION-READY PRD for the GRUHA Platform that:

AI coding tools like Google Anigravity / Cursor / GitHub Copilot can directly consume

developers with ZERO context can build from

avoids hallucination and scope drift

matches real-world disaster governance + fintech reality

is architecturally correct

has UI/UX level comparable to Awwwards / Dribbble world-class designers

is reliable during disasters, low connectivity, stress environments

🔥 Understanding the Project (Base Context — DO NOT SKIP)

GRUHA is a mobile-first + web disaster resilience + relief + economic recovery platform for MSMEs.

It works across 3 phases:

1️⃣ BEFORE DISASTER — Preparedness

Early warning alerts (voice + SMS fallback)

Warehouse discovery + booking

Transport discovery + booking

Government Readiness Credits (blockchain tokens pegged to INR)

Vendors receive INR

2️⃣ DURING DISASTER — Stability

offline capability

emergency mode UI

queued transactions

SMS confirmation layer

evacuation safe-zone linked warehousing

fair price disaster policy enforcement

3️⃣ AFTER DISASTER — Recovery

Government issues Relief Stable Tokens

MSME spends via GRUHA ecosystem

Vendors always receive INR

Controlled category spending

Full public transparent auditability

Fraud resistant

Marketplace + Payment Orchestration Hybrid Model

Recovery Marketplace Includes:

warehouse vendors

transport vendors

repair vendors

equipment servicing partners

raw material suppliers

temporary shop providers

power & generator providers

wage distribution partners

verified NGO + CSR partners

Blockchain Role

permissioned stable tokens pegged to INR

programmable spending rules

public audit logs

vendor + MSME whitelisting

fraud + anomaly checks

no crypto withdrawal

no speculation

Banking Role

vendors ALWAYS receive INR

instant settlement via liquidity pool

government reimburses pool later
